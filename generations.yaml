    description: "The first generation Kia Stonic was introduced as the brand's entry into the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment. Built on the same platform as the Rio hatchback, the Stonic featured distinctive styling with a two-tone roof option, bold color choices, and angular design elements. The interior offered a straightforward layout with a 7-inch touchscreen featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included small displacement engines such as a 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder, 1.2L and 1.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinders, and a 1.6L diesel in some regions. Most models were front-wheel drive only, positioning the Stonic as an urban crossover rather than an off-road capable SUV. Despite its compact dimensions, the Stonic offered relatively practical interior space and cargo capacity for its class. Safety features included available autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and driver attention warning, though specifications varied significantly by market."

    description: "The refreshed Kia Stonic received design updates including revised LED headlights, updated wheel designs, and new exterior color options while maintaining its overall styling theme with the distinctive two-tone roof option. Interior improvements focused on technology, with an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, enhanced UVO Connect telematics, and a digital instrument display on higher trim levels. The powertrain lineup was updated to include a 48-volt mild-hybrid system paired with the 1.0L turbocharged engine in some markets, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Additional driver assistance features were added, including adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and an improved version of the lane-keeping assist system. The refreshed model continued to target urban drivers looking for style, technology, and maneuverability in a compact package. Despite increased competition in the segment, the Stonic maintained its position through its combination of distinctive styling, improved technology, and Kia's increasingly strong brand reputation for value and reliability."
